<!-- # Workshop on Data Science for Justice Delivery in India (DSJDI-2022) -->
## About the workshop
The judicial system in India is under tremendous pressure. As of May 2022, over 4.7 crore cases are pending in courts across different levels of the judiciary. Advances in digital technology  have made it possible to store and retrieve huge repository of legal documents.    Apart from the size of data, the inherent complexity of legal domain demand better and more sophisticated methods to process legal documents to satisfy the information need of legal practitioners thereby improving the efficiency of all components of justice delivery system. This workshop focuses on  challenges to build data science based legal decision support systems  to improve the efficiency of legal practitioners, judges and the other stakeholders involved in the justice delivery. 

## Scope
There is a scope to exploit the latest data science technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data and machine learning,  for better  retrieval of all kinds of legal data to improve the performance of the stakeholders of  justice delivery in India.  The objective of workshop is to bring researchers who are working on the topics of data science  and legal domain together and carry out exchange regarding building systems to improve quality and scalability of  legal information systems. The workshop will also bring together researchers and practitioners in legal studies and data analytics who are interested in legal information retrieval to improve the efficiency of stakeholders in legal domain.

## Program
The workshop is structured around ongoing research efforts in investigating data science approaches to build decision support systems for legal domain.  This workshop is a collection of  keynote talks, invited presentations and a panel.
